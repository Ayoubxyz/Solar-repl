You are building a website for Solar-Gear, a solar energy solutions company. The website needs to serve both residential and commercial customers, showcasing products and service packages while driving conversions. The site must balance visual appeal with functionality, featuring modern animations and a clear path to purchase. Reference the existing site at https://solargearltd.netlify.app/ for company details, brand identity, and current offerings.

Task

Create a complete 4-page responsive website with the following structure:

Home Page: Include an animated hero section that immediately captures attention and communicates Solar-Gear's value proposition. Feature key benefits, social proof, and clear calls-to-action directing visitors to products and packages.

About Page: Present Solar-Gear's mission, expertise, and credibility in the solar energy industry. Include team information, company values, certifications, and reasons why customers should choose Solar-Gear.

Products Page: Design a visually appealing product catalog featuring solar inverters, batteries, panels, and additional solar equipment. Each product should display with high-quality imagery, specifications, pricing, and an intuitive purchase or inquiry mechanism.

Packages Page: Create two distinct package sections - one for residential customers (3 home packages) and one for commercial customers (3 business packages). Each package should clearly outline what's included, pricing tiers, and benefits, with strong conversion-focused design elements.

Objective

The website should maximize conversions by combining exceptional visual design with strategic user experience. Every page must guide visitors toward making a purchase decision or requesting a consultation. The site should establish Solar-Gear as a trustworthy, professional solar energy provider while making it effortless for customers to understand options and take action.
